 <h1>Animation and Art created using pure HTML and CSS</h1>
Welcome to my Git repository! <br>Here, you'll find a collection of animations and art pieces that I've created using pure HTML and CSS.

Animations
I've created a variety of animations using CSS, ranging from simple hover effects to more complex animations using keyframes. Some of my favorite animations include:

A bouncing ball animation
A spinning wheel animation
A flickering candle animation
A pulsing heart animation
Each animation is contained in its own HTML file, so you can easily view and modify them as needed.

 <h2>Art Pieces</h2>
In addition to animations, I've also created a number of art pieces using CSS. These include:

A sunset scene created using gradients
A pixel art portrait of a cat
A geometric pattern created using transforms
A landscape scene created using CSS shapes
Like the animations, each art piece is contained in its own HTML file for easy viewing and modification.

,h2>How to Use</h2>
To view the animations and art pieces in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the HTML files in your browser. You can also modify the files to create your own custom animations and art pieces using pure HTML and CSS.
